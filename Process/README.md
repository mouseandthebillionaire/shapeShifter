Digital Relic and Mouse & the Billionaire back at it again!

## Initial Brainstorming | 01.21.25

Question: how can we take some of the ideas from [LTHC](www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/lthc/) and create an experience that is:
- collaborative
- slightly more puzzly/playful
- still reflective/contemplative and musical

Ideas:
- two smaller controller boxes that are facing each other
- a transparent screen between the two players with shared information
- some sort of hidden information. Perhaps by the physical nature of the transparency of the shared screen, or on a secondary screen that only individual players have access to
- some shared goal that they are trying to achieve. There's something about holding something in place while the other player moves _their_ part. Two people screwing in a lightbulb.
- What if the individual screens in front of each player was a touch screen? And you have to manipulate and hold something on the screen while communicating with the other player?
- Tangrams: you make shapes with your fingers, and combining that shape with the other player's shape unlocks the goal. 
- Increasingly difficult challenges. Starting with one finger, then making lines with two fingers, then shapes with three fingers.
- The line challenges could be like Ice Cold Beer
- Is Max/MSP + MIRA a possible solution for the touchscreen interaction?

Next:
- Can you run two MIRA instances from two different iPads?
- Can the shapes you draw show up in a jit.pwindow in the MIRA frame?
- Can MIRA be fullscreen enough for it to be a seamless interface?
- We still want to use at least one rotary dial. What could that be used for? What if there are two?
